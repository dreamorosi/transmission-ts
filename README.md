- `path`: The path to the Transmission RPC server. Defaults to `/transmission/rpc`.

### Add a torrent

You can add a torrent by passing in a magnet link

```ts
const torrent = await client.addMagnet({
  magnet: "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
});
```

While adding a torrent you can also pass in any of the following options:

- `downloadDir`: The directory where the downloaded contents will be saved in. Defaults to the default download directory configured in Transmission.
- `paused`: Whether or not the torrent should be added in a paused state. Defaults to `false`.

### List torrents

You can get all torrents or only some of them by specifying a list of ids:

```ts
// List all torrents currently in Transmission
const torrents = await client.getTorrents();
// List torrents with ids 1 and 2
const torrents = await client.getTorrents({
  ids: [1, 2],
});
```

You can also use the `recently-active` keyword to get the most recently active torrents:

```ts
const torrents = await client.getTorrents({
  ids: "recently-active",
});
```

When getting torrents you can also select which fields you want to receive by passing in a list of fields:

```ts
const torrents = await client.getTorrents({
  fields: ["id", "name", "status"],
});
```

A full list of fields can be found in the [API reference](). If you don't pass in any fields, all fields will be returned.

### Remove torrents

You can remove torrents by passing in one or more ids:

```ts
// Remove torrent with id 1
await client.removeTorrents({
  ids: 1,
});
// Remove torrents with ids 1 and 2
await client.removeTorrents({
  ids: [1, 2],
});
// Remove torrent and delete downloaded data
await client.removeTorrents({
  ids: 1,
  deleteLocalData: true,
});
```

When removing torrents you can also specify whether or not you want to delete the downloaded data by setting the `deleteLocalData` option to `true`. Defaults to `false`.
```

When deleting torrents you can also specify whether or not you want to delete the downloaded data by setting the `deleteLocalData` option to `true`. Defaults to `false`.
